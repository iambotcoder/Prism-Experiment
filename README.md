## Introduction

This project is an interactive simulation that showcases the phenomenon of light refraction when passing through a prism. It is implemented using the `graphics.h` library in C/C++, providing a visual representation of how light bends and separates into its constituent colors when interacting with a prism.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of light passing through a prism.
- Visualization of light bending and splitting into its constituent colors.
- Educational tool to explore the principles of refraction and dispersion of light.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following:

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).
- The `graphics.h` library (usually provided by the Turbo C/C++ compiler).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Prism-Refraction.git
```

2. Ensure you have the `graphics.h` library properly installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your preferred C/C++ IDE.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Interact with the simulation to observe the phenomenon of light refraction through the prism.
4. Experiment with different parameters to understand how the angle and nature of light affect the refraction process.

## Contributing
