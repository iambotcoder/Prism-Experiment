## Phenomenon of Refraction of Light Using Prism

### Introduction

The "Prism-Experiment" project is a software program that simulates the phenomenon of the refraction of light using a prism. This interactive experiment allows you to understand and visualize how a prism bends light as it passes through, separating it into its constituent colors.

### Features

- Real-time simulation of light passing through a prism.
- Visualization of light bending and splitting into its constituent colors.
- Educational tool to explore the principles of refraction and dispersion of light.

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The Pygame library for graphical rendering.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Prism-Experiment.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```shell
pip install pygame
```

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the experiment by executing the main Python script:

```shell
python prism_experiment.py
```

3. Interact with the simulation to see how light bends and refracts when passing through a prism.
